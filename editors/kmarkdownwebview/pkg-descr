This is
* a Markdown viewer KParts plugin which allows KParts-using applications
  to display files in Markdown format in the target format
* a Markdown file KIO thumbnail generator plugin which allows KIO-powered
  file managers & dialogs to show thumbnails and previews of files in
  Markdown format in the target format (currently only available when
  building against QtWebKit)

The software is inspired by the WebEngine Markdown Editor Example from
the Qt documentation. The plain text file data is fed into a webpage via
a QWebChannel or QtWebKit bridge, where a JavaScript library creates HTML
from it which then is displayed.
